Installation
============

First, install the required software.

1. Python >= 2.7 from http://www.python.org/
   
   Be sure to also have installed the included distutils module.
   On most distributions, the distutils module is included in
   an extra ``python-dev`` package.


Now install the application.

1.
   a) Installation as root
      
      Run ``sudo python setup.py install`` to install patool.
   
   b) Installation as a normal user
      
      Run ``python setup.py install --home $HOME``. Note that you have
      to adjust your PATH and PYTHONPATH environment variables, eg. by
      adding the commands ``export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/lib/python`` and
      ``export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin`` to your shell configuration
      file.
      
      For more information look at the `Modifying Python's search path`_
      documentation.
